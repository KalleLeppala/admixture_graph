Description: Implements tools for building and visualising admixture graphs and for extracting
    equations from them. These equations can be compared to f-statistics obtained from data
    to test the consistency of a graph against data -- for example by comparing the sign of 
    f4 statistics with the signs predicted by the graph -- and graph parameters (edge lengths
    and admixture proportions) can be fitted to observed statistics.
